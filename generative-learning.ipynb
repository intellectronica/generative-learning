He didn't move quickly, didn't make a sound, just stood there, a silent, imposing shape in the dim light. His presence felt wrong, like a cold draft in a warm room.

Alex, a 25 year old person of other gender, sitting at the next desk, jumped violently when a floorboard creaked overhead on the empty floor above. They clutched their chest, eyes wide. It was well past midnight, the city lights distant pinpricks through the large window, confirming the late hour. A sudden cold draft swept through the room despite the still air. The dripping stopped. A slow, dragging sound replaced it, closer now. David swallowed hard. Sarah stifled a whimper. Alex slowly reached for the heavy stapler on their desk.

They had just left the office building a few blocks away, having successfully landed a major project they'd worked on for months. The relief and excitement bubbled up, turning their walk into a celebratory stroll.
