The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the polished grey floor tiles. Dust motes danced in the angled light beams slicing through the large window. It was unusually quiet for this time of day, the usual afternoon chatter absent. A few other desks were visible, but mostly empty, adding to the stillness. Sarah sniffled quietly, pulling a tissue from a box on her cluttered desk. Her eyes were red-rimmed and downcast. David finally looked over, his own face etched with a quiet sorrow. He didn't say anything, just offered a small, sympathetic nod. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with unspoken grief. The hum of the old server rack in the corner seemed to mourn with them. Sarah wiped a tear that traced a path down her cheek. The office, usually a place of routine tasks, felt like a tomb of quiet sadness this afternoon.\n",

Beside him sat Eleanor, a female aged 65, her spectacles perched on her nose as she read a book, occasionally taking a quiet sip of her water. Their presence was peaceful. Closer to the polished oak bar, Liam, a male aged 32, was engaged in a low-voiced conversation with Chloe, a female aged 30. He leaned forward slightly, listening intently, while she gestured softly with one hand. The air hummed gently with the distant clinking of a glass and the low murmur of background music, creating a perfectly calm atmosphere on this afternoon.</td>\n",

He didn't move quickly, didn't make a sound, just stood there, a silent, imposing shape in the dim light. His presence felt wrong, like a cold draft in a warm room.

The air was thick with a silence that felt wrong, broken only by the faint, rhythmic dripping sound coming from somewhere beyond the closed conference room door. Alex, a 25 year old person of other gender, sitting at the next desk, jumped violently when a floorboard creaked overhead on the empty floor above. They clutched their chest, eyes wide. It was well past midnight, the city lights distant pinpricks through the large window, confirming the late hour. A sudden cold draft swept through the room despite the still air. The dripping stopped. A slow, dragging sound replaced it, closer now. David swallowed hard. Sarah stifled a whimper. Alex slowly reached for the heavy stapler on their desk. The sound grew louder, closer. Something was moving in the dark hallway. The mood was undeniably one of creeping terror.</td>\n",
