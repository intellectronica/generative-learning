They were in their office, surrounded by other empty desks, humming computers, and stacks of files. The fluorescent lights overhead cast a sterile glow. It was late afternoon; weak sunlight slanted through the blinds on the far window, painting long, pale stripes across the carpeted floor. The usual office bustle had faded, replaced by a heavy silence. Sarah dabbed at her eyes with a tissue, her shoulders slumping slightly. Mark let out a slow, shaky breath, the sound barely audible in the quiet room. The air between them felt thick with shared sadness, a quiet grief hanging heavy in the late day air.\n",

Beside her, Mark, a man aged 38, reclined against a fallen log, hands clasped behind his head, utterly absorbed in the vast, star-dusted canvas above. His breathing was deep and relaxed. A few feet away, Lily, an 8-year-old girl, hummed a soft, tuneless song while gently sifting cool earth through her fingers. Her older brother, Tom, a 10-year-old boy, lay flat on his back on a thick blanket, his gaze fixed on the silvery path the moon cast across the smooth, dark surface of the lake just beyond the trees. The air was cool and still, carrying only the clean scents of pine needles, damp soil, and woodsmoke. Aside from the occasional distant hoot of an owl or the almost inaudible lapping of water, the stillness was complete. They were deep in a secluded clearing, surrounded by ancient trees and the quiet presence of the water. A palpable sense of peace and tranquility settled over the small group, each person finding their own quiet space in the communal calm under the expansive night sky.</td>\n",

It was clearly an office environment, with rows of tidy desks, filing cabinets lining one wall, and a whiteboard covered in faded markers. Across the aisle, Mark, a male aged 45, was leaning back in his chair, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee beside his keyboard. He was looking out the large window, his expression peaceful and relaxed. The air in the room felt still and calm, a sense of tranquil productivity pervading the space. Neither person spoke, content in the quiet routine of the workday winding down. The light filtering through the blinds indicated the sun was lower in the sky, firmly placing the time in the afternoon. Everything felt unhurried and serene.</td>\n",

The office occupied the entire fifth floor, a sprawling maze of empty cubicles and silent computers under the glow of emergency lights. Desks stretched out into the gloom, monitors reflecting only the dim light. Outside the large windows, the city was a distant sparkle against the absolute black of the night sky. It was well after midnight, the building quiet and deserted. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, broken only by the faint, inexplicable sounds the old building seemed to make in the dark. A cold draft slithered through the space, raising goosebumps on Sarah's arms. Mark shifted his weight, the sound unnaturally loud. They both felt it, the palpable sense of not being alone, of unseen eyes watching them from the shadows that clung to the edges of the empty office. It was an oppressive, chilling feeling.</td>\n",
