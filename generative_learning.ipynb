       "The Crown and Anchor was unusually quiet. Dust motes danced in the single weak shaft of sunlight cutting through the gloom from a high window. John, a man in his early forties, nervously tapped his fingers on the sticky table. Across from him, Sarah, barely twenty, jumped at the creak of a floorboard upstairs. An older man, David, likely in his sixties, watched them with unsettlingly calm eyes from a corner booth, his face obscured by shadow. By the bar, Clara, a woman appearing to be John's contemporary, polished a glass with slow, deliberate strokes, her gaze fixed on something unseen. A sudden draft sent a shiver through the room. The air felt heavy, expectant, filled with a silent dread that made the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.\n",
